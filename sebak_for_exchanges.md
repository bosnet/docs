### Test account creation through 'sebak-angelbot' in localhost enviroment

#### How to create account using 'sebak-angelbot'?

- Running sebak node as [standalone](http://devteam.blockchainos.org/docs/SEBAK-deployment-standalone/) mode.
- Execute sebak command `$ sebak key generate` as much as you want. this key pair will be used to create new account in sebak node. We recommend almost 100 keypair.
- Open text editor and put secret-keys line by line and save in `sources.txt` file.
- Running 'sebak-angelbot' in your localhost. In 'sebak-anglebot' command line options, we recommend `--secret-seed` to be secret seed of `genesis account`.
- From now you can create new accounts.
- You can check account existed or not, when you used `http(or https)://localhost:12345/api/v1/accounts/<one of public address you set in sources.txt>`
